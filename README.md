### 📝 Notes

- If you provide me the **exact type of projects (e.g., glassmorphism card, loader animation, etc.)**, I can update the **“Previews”** and each section with more concrete data.
- Also, if your repo link is deployed anywhere (like Netlify/Vercel), send me the URLs and I’ll update this README accordingly.

Would you like me to:
1. Add screenshots to the preview tables?
2. Generate live preview demos via CodePen or embed method?
3. Write a README per project inside the folders?

Let me know, and I’ll enhance it further!
